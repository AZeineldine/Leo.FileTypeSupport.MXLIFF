# MXLIFF

MXLIFF documents, as generated by Memsource. Documents may be untranslated, partially or fully translated.

Once installed, you will find that MXLIFF will now be listed under File Types in the project settings of SDL Trados Studio.

If you install the filetype and then don’t see it in your list, or you think the installation was too fast and it didn’t seem to do anything, then please go to Options -> Fileypes and then look on the right. It probably says "additional filetypes exist". Click that, select the missing filetype you installed and you'll be good to go.
